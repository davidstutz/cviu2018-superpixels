Up to now, we used \ARec, \AUE and \AEV to summarize experimental results for $\K \in [200,5200]$.
However, for some applications, generating $\K \gg 5200$ superpixels may be interesting.

For $\K \approx 20000$, superpixel algorithms can be used to dramatically reduce the
number of primitives for subsequent processing steps with negligible loss of information.
We consider Table \ref{table:experiments-k}
presenting \Rec, \UE, \EV, runtime in seconds $t$ and \K for $\K \approx 20,000$ on
the \BSDS dataset. We note that some algorithms were not able to generate $\K \gg 5200$
superpixels and are, therefore, excluded. Similarly, we excluded algorithms not offering
control over the number of generated superpixels. We observe that except for \VC and \PF all
algorithms achive $\Rec \geq 0.99$, $\UE \approx 0.03$, and $\EV > 0.9$. Furthermore, the runtime of
many algorithms is preserved. For example \W and \CW still run in below $10ms$ and the
runtime for \preSLIC and \SLIC increases only slightly. Obviously, the number of
generated superpixels varies more strongly for large~\K. Overall, most algorithms
are able to capture the image content nearly perfectly while reducing
 $321 \times 481 = 154401$ pixels to $\K \approx 20000$ superpixels.
