\subsection{Robustness}
\label{subsec:experiments-robustness}

Similar to Neubert and Protzel \cite{NeubertProtzel:2012}, we investigate the influence
of noise, blur and affine transformations.
We evaluated all algorithms for $\K \approx 400$ on the \BSDS dataset.
In the following we exemplarily discuss salt and pepper noise and average blurring.

	In particular, \reSEEDS and \reFH show slightly better performance which may be explained by
	improved connectivity. \vlSLIC, in contrast, shows similar performance to \SLIC and, indeed,
	the implementations are very similar. Finally, \preSLIC reduces runtime by reducing the number
	of iterations spend on individual superpixels.

Most algorithms are robust to salt and pepper noise; blurring, in contrast, tends
to reduce performance. We consider Figure \ref{subfig:experiments-robustness-noise} showing \Rec, \UE and \K
for $p \in \{0, 0.04,$ $0.08, 0.12, 0.16\}$ being the probability of a pixel being salt or pepper.
Note that Figure \ref{subfig:experiments-robustness-noise} shows the number of
superpixels $K$ before enforcing connectivity as described in Section \ref{subsec:parameter-optimization-connectivity}.
As we can deduce, salt and pepper noise only slightly reduces \Rec and \UE for most algorithms.
Some algorithms compensate the noise by generating more superpixels such as \VCr or \SEAWr
while only slightly reducing performance. In contrast, for \QSr the performance even increases
-- a result of the strongly increasing number of superpixels.
Similar results can be obtained for Gaussian additive noise.
Turning to Figure \ref{subfig:experiments-robustness-blur}
showing \Rec, \UE and \K for $k \in \{0, 5, 9, 13, 17\}$ being the size of a box
filter used for average blurring. As expected, blurring leads to reduced performance with
respect to both \Rec and \UE. Furthermore, it leads to a reduced number of generated
superpixels for algorithms such as \QSr or \VCr. Similar observations can be made for motion blur as well as Gaussian blur.

    \caption{The influence of salt and pepper noise for $p \in \{0, 0.04, 0.08, 0.12, 0.16\}$ being the
    probability of salt or pepper. Regarding \Rec and \UE, most algorithms are not
    significantly influence by salt and pepper noise. Algorithms such as
    \QS and \VC compensate the noise by generating additional superpixels.

    \input{plots/robustness-blur}
    \caption{The influence of average blur for $k \in \{0, 5, 9, 13, 17\}$ being
    the filter size. As can be seen, blurring gradually reduces performance
    -- which may be explained by vanishing image boundaries. In addition, for
    algorithms such as \VC and \QS, blurring also leads to fewer superpixels being generated.

Overall, most superpixel algorithms are robust to the considered noise models,
while blurring tends to reduce performance. Although the corresponding experiments are omitted for brevity,
we found that affine transformations do not influence performance.
