\section{Experiments}
\label{sec:appendix-experiments}

We complement Section \ref{sec:experiments} with additional experimental results.
In particular, we provide additional qualitative results to better judge the visual
quality of individual superpixel algorithms. Furthermore, we explicitly present \ASA and \UEL
on the \BSDS and \NYU datasets as well as \Rec, \UE and \EV on the \SBD, \SUNRGBD and \Fash datasets.
